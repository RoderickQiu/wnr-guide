When you open wnr, it looks like that. **Just enter the numbers, and a timer will be set.**

First, **there will be a period of work time, and then a period of rest time**.

It will repeat for the time you entered in "loop for".

Title and notes are selective.

You can also see how many time in total this schedule is going to cost.

(You can have your time with wnr's **full-screen focus mode** to prevent you from using you computer, too.)

We've introduced our new **[predefined tasks system](./../settings/2-predefined-tasks-settings.md)**, by using this, you can have multiple sets of work periods and rest periods.

If you want, you can also make the wnr start its default task each time it is launched by modifying settings.

## Timer: Work Time

As the key **<kbd>Enter</kbd>** is clicked, the timer starts. **Now, go & do your work!**

You can hide the window to the system tray (The hotkey is <kbd>Ctrl+Shift+Alt+W</kbd>, in default) if you are going to do some computer-relative work.

The timer can be paused(<kbd>||</kbd>), skipped(<kbd>>></kbd>) or given up(<kbd><</kbd>) when you have to stop to do another thing. _(Not for focus mode)_

When there is only 1 minute left, a notification is sent.

When the time ends, a warning is given.

And another period of time starts.

## Timer: Finished

# Statistics

The timing statistics is a new function which was added to wnr in version 1.17.

## How to enter

Just as same as entering settings.

Windows users can click wnr's icon on the software's index page and find "statistics" in the dropdown menu. As for macOS users, they can start the feature from the tray or click options -> statistics in the top bar.

You are able to see how much time you spent on your computer using wnr, as well as how much time you worked and rested.

If you want, you can even use "this week" and "this year" pages to compare your data side-by-side.

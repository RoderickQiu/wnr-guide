# 2. Predefined Tasks

The predifined tasks system was recently introduced to wnr. As the alternative to the default time settings, **predefined tasks settings give you the freedom to have more than 1 default settings**, which is useful when you have different schedules, like for working time and time at home.

## Default Task

There are two kinds of tasks, one is default task, and another form is not. Default task cannot be deleted.

**The content of the default task will show as the one with red title in the settings, and it'll be automatically filled to the index page.**

If you want, you can check the *Auto start default task when wnr is launched* section in [Global Settings](./3-global-settings.html).

The tasks with blue title on are common tasks.

You can set them default or delete them.

By clicking the **green <kbd>Add</kbd> in the bottom of the settings**, a new setting can be added.

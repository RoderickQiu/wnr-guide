**You can manually check for update, set hotkeys, delete all settings here.**

Don't try to delete all settings if you are not willing to have a new clean set-up.

Sometimes wnr sends notifications. If you want to disable them, go to the operating system's settings. On Windows, we 're using [SnoreToast](https://github.com/KDE/snoretoast) to send tips. It's a lite and green service programed by the KDE organization.

According to the Windows' policy, any software that wants to send messages must create a link in the start menu, so does SnoreToast.

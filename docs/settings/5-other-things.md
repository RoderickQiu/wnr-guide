# 5. Other Things

**You can manually check for update, set hotkeys, delete all settings, backup / import wnr settings here.**

Don't try to delete all settings if you are not willing to have a new clean set-up.

Sometimes wnr sends notifications. If you want to disable them, go to the operating system's settings.

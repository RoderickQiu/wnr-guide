# 3. Global Settings

**The items with blue circle filled are currently checked.**

Some items with the tip *"The software will automatically restart"* will just make wnr restart, don't be shocked.

For the "Language" section, if the checkbox is checked, wnr will display in English, or else in Chinese.

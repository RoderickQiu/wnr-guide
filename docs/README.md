## Minimalistic & Elegant

Follows the **minimalistic** design style to make it simple but strong.

Supports retina screens and touchscreens. Works fine with dark mode.

## Fullscreen Focus

Always fails using a time management software? Try our fullscreen focus mode.

It seems that there **haven't been an app that is as strong as wnr**, when it comes to controlling your time.

**Rest when you should rest, work when you should work**.

## Precise & Humanized

Just start timing and **that's all**. Just wait to be notified when the timer is over.

Any unfinished timer would be automatically resumed when you reopened wnr.

A **floating window** is available here, too.

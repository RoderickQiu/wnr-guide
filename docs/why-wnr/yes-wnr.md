# Yes, wnr

Why you need wnr? I think there are basically three reasons.

- People often study or work too much in a row, which can lead to the decline of working efficiency.

- People sometimes stare at the screen all the day.

- People sometimes relax too much.

**And wnr aimes to solve these problems**.

What's more:

- wnr has a mordern interface.

- wnr has got multi-lingual support.

- wnr has got some feature to make the rules more strict, so that **you must work and you must rest**.

- wnr has got lock mode, etc.

- wnr is easier and more convinient to use with fine settings, including predefined tasks settings.
